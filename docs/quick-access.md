# Quick Access
ClusterCut runs quietly in the background, but it's always accessible via your system's menu bar or system tray.

## System Tray / Menu Bar

Clicking the ClusterCut icon in your system tray (Windows/Linux) or menu bar (macOS) gives you quick access to:

-   **Show Window**: Show the ClusterCut window.
-   **Auto Send**: Enable/Disable Automatically sending local clipboard to the cluster.
-   **Auto Receive**: Enable/Disable Automatically receiving clipboard from the cluster.
-   **Quit**: Completely exit the ClusterCut application.

## GNOME Quick Settings
If you're using GNOME, you may not be able to/want to see the system tray icon. You can instead use ClusterCut's GNOME Quick Settings integration. When starting ClusterCut for the first time, you will be prompted to install the GNOME integration extension.

Once installed, you'll have access to the same features as the system tray icon, but from GNOME's quick settings area.
