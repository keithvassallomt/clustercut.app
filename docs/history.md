# Clipboard History

ClusterCut maintains a secure, local history of your clipboard activity, allowing you to quickly access previously copied items.

## How it works
Every time you copy text or a file on any device in a cluster, that item you copied will appear in the History screen on all devices in the Cluster.

::: info History Security
The history is stored in an encrypted format on the cluster devices, and is deleted from your device once it leaves the cluster.
:::

The history shows you whether you sent or received an item, and if received it shows you which device sent it.

## Managing History
Once an item is in the history, you have a few options (depending on the type of item, and whether you sent or received it).

| ![Copy](/history_copy.png) | Copy the item to your clipboard, without sending it to others in the cluster |
| ![Delete](/history_delete.png) | Delete the item from the history **of all devices in the cluster** |

| ![Send](/history_send.png) | Send the item to others in the cluster |
