# Settings

Configure ClusterCut to fit your workflow.

## General
**Start on Startup**: Automatically launch ClusterCut when you log in.

## Device Settings
Here you can change the name of your device as it appears on the cluster. By default, this is set to your device's hostname.

## Cluster Mode
- **Autogenerated**: This is the default mode. ClusterCut will automatically generate a random cluster name and PIN, which you can use on other devices. 
- **Provisioned**: This allows you to manually set a cluster name and PIN. This can be useful if you want to set a more memorable PIN, or if you want to have a provisioned cluster name and PIN that you can use on other devices.

::: warning Naming and Security
The cluster name cannot spaces, and the PIN must contain at least 6 characters.

## Synchronization
By default, ClusterCut will automatically send your clipboard contents to the cluster, and overwrite your local clipboard with incoming content from the cluster. However, this can be disabled if you prefer to manually control clipboard synchronization.

To prevent your clipboard contents from being automatically sent to the cluster, disable **Automatic Send**. Similarly, to prevent your local clipboard from being overwritten by incoming content from the cluster, disable **Automatic Receive**.

Disabling one of the above option allows you to set a global clipboard shortcut to manually send or receive clipboard contents.

In the above example, **Automatic Send** has been disabled, and the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+C` has been set to manually send clipboard contents to the cluster. With that set, `CTRL+C` (or `CMD+C` on macOS) will no longer send your clipboard to the cluster, but you can use the configured shortcut when you want to do so.

### Manual Send/Receive
When you disable either **Automatic Send** or **Automatic Receive**, ClusterCut will display an action button in the main UI when content is available to send or receive.

For example, with **Automatic Send** disabled, you can use the action button to manually send your clipboard to the cluster.

## File Transfer
This section allows you to enable or disable file transfer to/from your computer.

The default Auto-Download limit is set to `50MB`. Here's how that works:

### Files <= Limit
When a file is received from the cluster which is `50MB` or less, it will automatically be downloaded, and your clipboard will be overwritten with the file contents, which you can then paste anywhere you like.

### Files > Limit
When a file is received from the cluster which is greater than `50MB`, you will receive a notification that a file is available for download. 

![File Notification](/large_file_notification.png)

Clicking this notification (or opening the **History** view) will show the available file and allow you to download it.

Once the file has been downloaded, you can then paste it anywhere on your device.

## Notifications
Here you can choose which notifications you want to receive.

| Notification | Description | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Device Joins | Receive a notification when a new device joins the cluster | On |
| Device Leaves | Receive a notification when a device leaves the cluster | On |
| Data Sent | Receive a notification when data is sent to the cluster | Off |
| Data Received | Receive a notification when data is received from the cluster | Off |
| Large File Transfers | Receive a notification when a large file is available for download | On |
